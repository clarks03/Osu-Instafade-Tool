This is a tool that allows you to edit your skins' hitcircle animation to instafade.

## Installation

Click [here](https://github.com/clarks03/Osu-Instafade-Tool/releases) to download the latest release! Download the .exe and run it to get going!

NOTE: you may receive some warnings when downloading. I received two when testing--the first was Google Chrome, and the second was Windows SmartProtect.

I think the first is because no one else has downloaded this program (hopefully this will be resolved with more downloads)
The second is because there's no author associated with the file (it was hard enough getting the .exe to work with PyInstaller; I don't care about it being an "unknown author".)

## Usage

Users will be prompted with this window upon downloading.

Press the "Browse" button to select a skin folder, and press submit once the skin has been selected.

From there, you will be prompted by this screen:

The skin will obviously look different depending on which skin you selected.

### Name

This should be self-explanatory; this is the name of the skin. NOTE: if you choose the same name as another skin in your skins folder, it will not work.

### Colours

You are provided with two options for colours--default or skin colour. Default colour is strongly recommended for bright skins, like doubletime-oriented skins. This is because the skin colour option will naturally darken the colour of the hitcircle.

If you choose the skin colour option, make sure you press one of the given combo colours from the drop-down menu, AND MAKE SURE TO PRESS UPDATE SO YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGES!! OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK!!

Once you have configured your skin accordingly, press submit to generate the skin.
